TravelMap_folium.py
To-Do List:
[] Create some sensible GUI for input/output options.
[] Error handling in any meaningful way
[] Groups for photopins to help with crowding
[] Add options to customize colors easier
[] Add option to switch number of persons, possibly on the fly based on input
[] Figure out a way to link the thumbnail to the fullsize image without forcing massive downloads
    Note: if this is an offline version (e.g. running on a personal tablet, where file size doesn't matter, the full images can be used)
[] Add option to switch folium tiles (background map). Other options are in there but commented out
      currently.
[] Figure out a better way to place the popups so photos near the top of the map don't experience   
      weirdness. Workaround: only place map pin in the tropics. :D
